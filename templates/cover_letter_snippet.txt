<p>I have always enjoyed working in multi-disciplinary fields where the intersection of ideas and technology creates possibilities that are more than the sum of the parts. My background contains a broad array of technical and leadership experience for focused teams of scientists, engineers, designers and programmers. I enjoy complex spatial problem solving, advanced machine learning algorithms and piles of data especially when coupled to modern distributed processing systems. I have a passion for location- based and other geographic data, simple yet compelling visualizations and elegant product designs.
<p>Over the past fifteen years I have maintained a steady track record of solid product deliveries for a wide variety of customers across academia, government and private industry. A few examples of my recent work include the design of a Hadoop Map/Reduce-based distributed image processing system for AFRL, a Constellation Coverage analysis and visualization package for the GPS Program (Java/C++), a financial planning web application for a commercial customer (HTML5/PHP/CSS/SQL) and a payroll processing system (Java) for a client in the health services industry. I maintain a few personal projects and continue to support small collaborative efforts with friends. I like to keep up on latest technologies and dabble with a few from time to time including Pig, Storm, Python on AppEngine and Mahout.
<p>Over the course of my professional career I have been able to contribute to some truly out of this world projects, literally they’re in space on board satellites, and I have ambitions to continue to design and develop new and innovative concepts and products of the same caliber. It would be a pleasure to contribute to the next generation of projects as part of the team at Uber.

<p>If you or any of the Management or Staff at Uber have any questions or would like to set up a meeting date/time please feel free to contact me via email or phone.
