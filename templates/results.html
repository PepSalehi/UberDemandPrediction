      		<p>The predicted results of this simple linear regression model by Day of Epoch, Hour of Day and Day of the Week does pretty well. The predictions for May 1 through May 15, 2012 clearly follow the same diurnal and weekly patterns seen in the original data set: plenty of late Saturday nights rolling over to Sunday mornings, higher demand on weekends and little to no activity in the middle of the night. Keep in mind this data is in UTC so there is a little shift in the actual local time - those 6am UTC hits are actually more like 3am EDT. The overall character, trends and patterns are similar to the training data.</p>

      		<p>The model could certainly benefit from a more significant number of samples over a longer duration (a full year) and the incorporation of additional ancillary data about the region such as:
      		<ul>
      			<li>Holidays</li>
      			<li>Special Events</li>
      			<li>Weather</li>
      			<li>Days Since Opening of Market</li>
      			<li>Days Since New Product Launch (UberX)</li>
      		</ul>
      		</p>
      		
      		<p>The overall robustness and accuracy of demand prediction could be enhanced further by employing more sophisticated statistical models that can utilize continuous and categorical data such as Classification And Regression Tree (CART) Analysis or leverage a continuous update of information on a daily or hourly basis with a Bayesian approach like a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This software is written in a modular fashion so the modelling method could be swapped out and upgraded at anytime while retaining the funtionality of the <a href="api.html">API</a>.</p>
