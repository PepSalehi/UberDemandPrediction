				<p>I hope you have found this API useful and up to the standards Uber expects from a Rock Star Data Scientist. It was a very interesting project to undertake. The data set seemed innocuous at first but once I dug in a little more it became apparent that there was more than meets the eye. There were several quite interesting aspects of human society encapsulated in this concise data set... I'm curious to find out more...  </p>
